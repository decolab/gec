  "description": "This repository provides a MATLAB implementation of the Generative Connectivity of the Arrow of Time (GCAT) framework,\n"
  "developed to investigate how the hierarchical organisation of brain activity changes under naturalistic conditions.\n"
  "Specifically, it enables the analysis of fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), comparing movie-watching and rest.\n"
  "The GCAT metric quantifies directionally-resolved effective connectivity across cortical regions,\n"
  "offering a novel approach to assess the breakdown of hierarchical brain structures during ecologically valid stimulation.\n"
